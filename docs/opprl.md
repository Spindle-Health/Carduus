# Open Privacy Preserving Record Linkage

Open Privacy Preserving Record Linkage (OPPRL) is a protocol for a privacy preserving record linkage system that can be implemented across data systems to assist in the de-identification of data in a way that preserves privacy while enabling sharing of data assets between trusted organizations.

Implementers can find the full specification on the [OPPRL Specification](opprl/PROTOCOL.md) page.

As an [open specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_specifications), all practitioners that interact with OPPRL implementations are invited to contribute to discussion, research, and proposals for improvements to the specification. For details on how to participate, see the OPPRL [contributing guide](opprl/contrib.md).
